# Lambda function, we discus about lambda function 

x = lambda x : x**2 
print(x(9))

a = lambda x,y: x+y
print(a(4,5))

# difference between normal function and lambda function 

"""
1. lambda has no return value
2. One line code 
3. Not used for code reusability
4. No name 
"""

# why we should used lambda function 
# along with higher order functions
