# let's learn about For Loop 

# IN for loop we descus about how we declare for loop and what the difference bitween for loop and while loop 

"""
while loop we use when we don't know about how many time process going on, there we need while loop.
but 
for loop we use then we know this process going of 10 times then we use for loop.

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)


# range() can take 3 arguments 1st one is start and 2nd one is stop and 3rd is steps let's see examples 

for i in range(1, 20, 3):
    print(i) # start printing from 1 to 20 but gap bitween 3 because of we declare 3 on steps part
